# DFS

Depth First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

***

### Algorithm

DFS works like solving a maze by following one path to its very end. If you hit a dead end, you backtrack to the last junction and try a different path. This "depth-first" strategy naturally uses a stack, which is handled implicitly by recursion in the provided code.

The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Start: Pick a starting vertex.
2. Visit and Mark: Mark the current vertex as visited to avoid cycles and redundant work. Add it to your traversal list.
3. Explore Deeper: For the current vertex, pick one of its unvisited neighbors and recursively call the DFS function on that neighbor.
4. Backtrack: Once all paths from a vertex have been fully explored (i.e., the recursive calls for all its neighbors have returned), the function for the current vertex returns, effectively "backtracking" to the previous vertex.
5. Repeat: This process continues until all vertices reachable from the start have been visited.

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void dfs(int node, vector<int> adj[], int vis[], vector<int> &ls) {
    // Mark the current node as visited
    vis[node] = 1;
    // Add the node to the result list
    ls.push_back(node);
    
    // Recursively visit all unvisited neighbors
    for (auto it : adj[node]) {
        if (!vis[it]) {
            dfs(it, adj, vis, ls);
        }
    }
}

vector<int> dfsOfGraph(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
    // 'vis' array to keep track of visited vertices, initialized to 0 (false).
    int vis[V] = {0};
    int start = 0;
    vector<int> ls; // List to store the DFS traversal

    // Start the recursive traversal from the 'start' node.
    dfs(start, adj, vis, ls);
    return ls;
}
```
